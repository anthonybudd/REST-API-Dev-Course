# Binary
Binary is a base-2 positional numeral system with a radix of 2. Each digit is referred to as a bit, represented as either a "0" or a "1".
  

In base-10, the first digit represents units, the 2nd from the right represents 10s, 3rd 100's, 4th 1000's and so on. In binary the first digit also represents units but the 2nd now represents 2's, the 3rd digit 4's, 4th digit 8's and so on. As shown in the animation below.
