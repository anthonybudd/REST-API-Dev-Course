# Web Development Course
Over the past few years I have had to train many low-level coders from the ground-up to mid-level Node.js REST API developers. To make this more streamline, I have decided to compile my training notes into a single repo for anyone who wants to learn the practical skills of REST API development.

This course is based arround my [Express API Boilerplate](https://github.com/anthonybudd/express-api-boilerplate). You will need to [clone](Course/Git.md#cloneing) this repo to follow allong with this.
